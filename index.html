        <h2>How African Names Are derived</h2>
            <p>African cultures have different ways of giving names to their new born babies. There are names given depending on the season the child is born. In other cultures, names are derived from the time a child is born. In this article, we look at how Ghanians do their naming.</p>
            <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day of the week they were born. For example a boy born on Sunday is named <em>Kwasi</em> while a girl born on Sunday is named <em>Akosua</em>.</p>
