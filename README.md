# Akan-Names
## What the code does
This article is going to show us how to derive Akan Names. African cultures do name their children differently. Akan name is one way of doing so. By using Akan, a child is given a name depending on  the day they were born, meaning, Sunday has a name attached to it, and so is Monday and the rest of the days of the week.
